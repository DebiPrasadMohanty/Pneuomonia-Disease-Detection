# Pneumonia Detection Model
  This repository contains an AI-powered tool for detecting pneumonia using chest X-ray images. Designed specifically for mobile devices, the model works offline, making it ideal for deployment in resource-limited settings where internet connectivity is scarce. The tool leverages deep learning techniques, including Xception architecture and Grad-CAM explainability, to provide real-time, reliable diagnoses.

# Features
Offline Functionality: The AI model operates directly on mobile devices, providing real-time inference without internet connectivity.
Explainable AI: Integrated with Grad-CAM for generating heatmaps that highlight the regions of the X-ray that influenced the AI's diagnosis.
Mobile Compatibility: Optimized for use on smartphones and low-power devices using TensorFlow Lite.
Freemium Model: A basic version is available for free, while a premium version includes advanced features such as enhanced Grad-CAM visualizations and patient management tools.
# How It Works
Input: The user uploads or captures a chest X-ray image.
Processing: The AI model, fine-tuned with transfer learning on pneumonia datasets, classifies the image as either showing signs of pneumonia or normal.
Output: A diagnostic result (Pneumonia Detected / No Pneumonia Detected) is displayed, along with an optional Grad-CAM heatmap for explainability.
# Model Details
Architecture: The model is based on the Xception architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on pneumonia datasets.
Performance: The model achieves near-perfect accuracy (99.70% at Epoch 12) in detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays.
Inference Time: The diagnostic process is completed in 1-2 seconds, even on low-power devices.
# Dataset
The model is trained on the Kaggle Pneumonia Dataset, which includes labeled chest X-rays for normal patients and those affected by pneumonia.

# Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DebiPrasadMohanty/Pneuomonia-Disease-Detection.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the model on your dataset:

bash
Copy code
python inference.py --image_path /path/to/your/xray/image
# Explainability
The Grad-CAM feature generates heatmaps that visually represent which areas of the X-ray contributed to the model's decision. This increases trust and transparency in AI-driven diagnostics.

# Business Model
The tool follows a freemium model:

Free Version: Allows limited scans and basic Grad-CAM visualizations.
Premium Version: Offers unlimited scans, enhanced visualizations, and patient management features.
Future Development
Integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems.
Expansion of the model to detect other lung diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, COVID-19).
Partnership with NGOs and healthcare programs to scale deployment in underserved areas.
